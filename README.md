# Legacy-Logitech-wheels-for-W11
2 drivers hacked together to make older logitech wheels play nice with W11 and W10.

There has been trouble for a few eons with older / legacy Logitech wheels,
not playing nice with Windows 10 and 11.
With this i am trying to first and foremost trying to fight the huge amount of e-waste, being generated unneccesarily.
but certainly also give people a way easier way to just make what they bought, actually work as it should.

Now, logitech gaming software wont be needed for this to work. I probably wont be able to fix that. 
There are however ways to have the UI show in the USB game controller menu, but decided not to include it as of yet.


To install the driver: 
- Download this repository (Click the down-arrow on the green "Code" button and click Download Zip).
- Ensure that logitech gaming software is uninstalled (Unless ofcourse you'd need it for something else).
- Unplug the wheel from the pc.
- Extract the downloaded zip into a folder of your choosing.
- Right-click _Install.bat and click "Run as Administrator"
- Plug in the wheel and have fun!

I have tested this with a G27 and a G25, but should also work with DFGT and other wheels, please let me know if you've got other models working!
Either here, on Reddit or Discord under the same nickname.
